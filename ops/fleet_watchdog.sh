# fleet_watchdog.sh -- auto-recovery for the GLM-5.3 vLLM multi-node fleet.
# Runs on the head (rank 0). Each probe checks that every rank's container is running,
# then /health, then a one-token canary request. On N consecutive failures it tears
# down ALL containers, runs the GB10 memory ritual, relaunches workers-first
# (rank 3 -> 2 -> 1) then the head (rank 0), waits for ready.
#
# Why more than /health: on DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, same vLLM multi-node mp executor,
# killing one worker left the head at /health 200 with nothing in its log, and client
# requests hung with no reply until an NCCL timeout took the head down ~6 min later
# (tsw2k/Deepseek-4.1-Flash-Quad-DGX-Sparks, failover test 2026-09-13). The engine
# blocks in a collective and stops logging, so neither /health nor log parsing sees
# it. Not reproduced on GLM-5.3 itself; the mechanism is the same.
#
# vLLM v1 CANNOT recover a dead engine core. Docker restart policies are unsafe
# here: headless workers exit 0 on head death (on-failure never fires) and the
# dead head often never exits at all. Full orchestrated relaunch is the only cure.
