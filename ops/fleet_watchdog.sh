# Runs on Reddie (head, rank 0). Probes /health; on N consecutive failures,
# tears down ALL containers, runs the GB10 memory ritual, relaunches
# workers-first (rank 3 -> 2 -> 1) then the head (rank 0), waits for ready.
#
# vLLM v1 CANNOT recover a dead engine core. Docker restart policies are unsafe
# here: headless workers exit 0 on head death (on-failure never fires) and the
# dead head often never exits at all. Full orchestrated relaunch is the only cure.
